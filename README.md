# CP1895-flaskProject
Description:
The project is to create a web app to a collection of cooking recipes.
The project must use the following technologies:
1. Python Flask server to generate the html pages for the project.
2. Jinja2 templates to re-use html
3. Appropriate form validation.
4. CSS for html styles (default from boilerplate is also okay)
5. CSV files to store recipe information
6. Search functionality - Pandas to read in the information from CSV into data frames along with
suitable filter operations
7. Git and GitHub for version control
   
For a higher grade, you should implement the following as well: (please see rubric for more details)
1. Bootstrap to manage styles
2. Deploy to the web using a suitable platform like Python Anywhere or AWS
   
Required Functionality:
1. Homepage introducing the Website.
2. Page where recipes are displayed. Each collectible item displayed must include at least one
image and at least 3 text elements. For example, one recipe could include the following:
- Image for Recipe (Lasagna)
- List of ingredients (Pasta, tomato sauce, cheese, mushrooms, ground beef)
- Preparation Instructions (Layer the tomato sauce, cheese, mushrooms and group beef
between the Pasta, bake for 30 minutes at 375F)
- Serving Instructions (Serves 3-4 people)
3. Form to upload new recipes to the server. Need to have appropriate validation for form and
server side validation of data. Need to handle security related to upload of image file to only
allow image format and to prevent malicious files.
4. Page to remove recipes items.
5. Page to search recipes based on names / ingredients and selection should lead to item 2 above.
Use of Pandas is suggested for ease.
